   Hello,

   I have reviewed the SDET position job posting and I am genuinely excited about the opportunity to work 
with your team. As a Mathematics graduate from Selçuk University with 2 years of testing/QA experience, 
I am confident in my ability to plan and coordinate various phases of the testing process (preparation, execution, result comparison).

   In my projects, I utilized Java with Selenium WebDriver and implemented the Cucumber framework. 
I applied robust design patterns like POM (Page Object Model) and Singleton Design Pattern to ensure 
maintainable and scalable test automation. Java is my area of expertise, and I can develop automation 
tests using this language. Designing test scenarios with a Cucumber-based approach offers a significant 
advantage, making the tests more comprehensible and easily maintainable.

   Additionally, my experience in automating test processes and working with basic SQL servers allows me 
to be more efficient in my role. Being proficient in Java, I am also eager to learn C# in a short period.

   With knowledge in Regression, Systems Integration, User Acceptance, and Performance Testing, I am driven 
to identify issues early in the development process. My attention to detail and ability to manage time 
effectively within a team make me a reliable team player.

   I have advanced writing and documentation skills, and my verbal English proficiency is intermediate.

   I am thrilled about the potential collaboration and look forward to further discussions.

   Best regards,
   Şeyma
